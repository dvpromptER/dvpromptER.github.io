    <td>I concentrated well in class and could remeber the things that I was told. I followed the code well and was able to make it work. I also asked my classmates for help aswell.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that the fact that this our first week makes it a bit hard to use the software. This is the first time i've used it. As a habit, I think I should have concentrated a bit more because I had to end up asking my classmates for a little help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I should concentrate more in class and if I do this, I will know exactly what to do and I shouldnâ€™t need help. Also remember to add the = sign at the start when I write my code in. I also think I could have added more things to my electronic shop and this would have made it better. I could also have added code so it can make a total of how much the shop items would cost.</td>
