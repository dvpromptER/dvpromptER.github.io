(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes. I did. I was able to understand how to post blogs on github using gabriel and  learnt how to get started with github.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I focused on what the teacher was telling us to do and I followed the steps that we were shown carefully. I did struggle a little bit because at the start there was a little bit too much information to take in like the code and the things we had to do in the settings. Eventhough this happened, I was still able to do what we had to. I think that as the weeks go on, I will become less confused and i will be able to use github more confdently.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that the fact that this is our first lesson at using github limited my learning. I knew nothing about it at the start. I think I need to make notes when told an instruction so I don't forget it. These notes will help me in the future wheather itâ€™s in class or at home.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>If stuck, ask questions to the teacher. This will obviously benefit my knowledge and will help me in the future. Also, as I said before, make notes if possible. I think I should try to work hard at home so when I get to class, github will be easier to use. Finally, I think I should explore github when at home.</td>
