    <td>I did what the teacher told us to do and that was to improve my github page. I was able to change my avatar to a gif which was kind of cool and I was also able to change my font colour. I also went on the website that sir told us to go on. This time, I made a few notes, but these notes didn't really help me a lot as they were quite brief and vague.</td>

    <td>I think that I should write more detailed notes as that will help me in the future unlike my previous notes which were pretty much pointless.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think next lesson, I should bring in something new that I have learnt at home by researching. If I do more work at home, my github page will look better. Also, take detailed notes down. I think I should change my background as well as it is clashing with the font.</td>
