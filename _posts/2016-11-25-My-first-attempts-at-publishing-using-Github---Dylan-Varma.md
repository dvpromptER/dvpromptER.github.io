    <td>At the start, I think I did well.I was able to do all the things I needed to do. I did struggle a little bit as the lesson went on because the screens that we were told to go on had a lot of files and information that I didn't need to know yet. This confused me a little, but I persevered and I got through it. The fact that this was my first attempt at github limited my learning. I knew nothing about it. From now on, I need to practice how to get to the right page quickly on github. It will help me in the future. I think I should ask more questions in class and this will also help me.

    <td>I think for next time, I should ask more questions in class. I should also make notes on what we are doing and that will help me in further lessons. I should also practice at home.</td>
