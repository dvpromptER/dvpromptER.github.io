    <td>I learnt by listening to the instructions and looking carefully at the steps that the teacher was showing me on the board. I also asked more questions this time and I definitely benefited from this. Asking more questions was my target for last week and I think I think I have improved.</td>

    <td>I think that since that this has only been my second lesson, I am still getting a little bit confused at the settings page but I think I did generally well in the main. I think I do need to take notes though because that will help me at home.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Make notes. Don't just ask the teacher questions, ask classmates as well. Also, don't worry if something goes wrong. Persevere and get through it. Believe in yourself that you can do it even if it is very hard. Also, work hard at home of things in the lesson did not go my way.</td>
