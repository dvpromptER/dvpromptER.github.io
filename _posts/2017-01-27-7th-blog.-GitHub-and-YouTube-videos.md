I did was what I was able to do and I followed the instructions well. I think that even though I followed the instructions well, I just wasn't fast enough.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>

I think that I should listen more carefully when watching the video so I would be quicker in embedding the video.</td>

    <td>

I think I need to write the code down when shown it so it will help me if I forget it in the future. Also I should watch some videos to help me develop my skills.</td>
