    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>I think I've done a lot this year and I have learnt a lot. My target at the start of the year was to learn a lot and to develop my IT skills a lot further. I did this and I now know how to do a lot.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>
Throughout the year, I tried to learn by asking questions, focusing, asking classmates and teachers for help and using the internet at home to help my blogs and repl quizzes.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

I think my main target to work on is to not get distracted whilst working. Throughout the year I faced many obstacles including many problems whilst making quizzes and the confusing world of code in github.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

Sadly, there won't be a next time, but for future references, I think that when someone is saying something very important which will not be said again, I should write brief notes. I should also ask for more help instead of just trying the same things for ages when I know it wonâ€™t work.</td>
